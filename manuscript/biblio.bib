                   deleterious mutations, a phenomenon known as Muller's
                   ratchet. We formulate discrete and continuous time versions
                   of Muller's ratchet. Inspired by Haigh's (1978) analysis of
                   a dynamical system which arises in the limit of large
                   populations, we identify the parameter gamma =
                   N*lambda/(Ns*log(N*lambda)) as most important for the speed
                   of accumulation of deleterious mutations. Here N is
                   population size, s is the selection coefficient and lambda
                   is the deleterious mutation rate. For large parts of the

                   deleterious mutations accumulate according to a power law in

              state of the latter is called the ancestral distribution, which
              turns out as a key for the study of mutation-selection balance.
              We find that the ancestral genotype frequencies determine the

              corresponding fitness values and discuss implications for the

              the equilibrium mean fitness to changes in the mutation rate. The

              a class of models in which the number of mutations in an

               Simulations show that it is mutations with only moderate
               unfavourable effect that lead to the most rapid decrease in
               fitness. We measure the number of fixations as a function of
               time and show that the fixation rate must be equal to the
               ratchet rate once a steady state is reached. Large bursts of
               fixations are observed to occur simultaneously. We relate this
               to the structure of the genealogical tree. We derive equations
               relating the rate of the ratchet to the moments of the
               distribution of the number of mutations k per individual. These
               equations interpolate between the deterministic limit (an
               infinite population with selection present) and the neutral
               limit (a finite size population with no selection). Both these
               limits are exactly soluble. In the neutral case, the
               distribution of k is shown to be non-self-averaging, i.e. the
               fluctuations remain very large even for very large populations.
               We also consider the strong-selection limit in which only
               individuals in the fittest surviving class have offspring. This
               limit is again exactly soluble. We investigate the structure of

              selection schemes employed are additive, multiplicative, and
              additive with a threshold. Although the third selection scheme is
              very different from the first two, the three schemes produce
              identical results for a wide range of parameter values. Thus the

               multilocus population genetics. We use a general representation
               of selection, recombination, and drift to analyze an idealized
               polygenic system in which all genetic effects are additive
               (i.e., both dominance and epistasis are absent), but no
               assumptions are made about the distribution of breeding values

               for the mean and additive variance if breeding values are
               Gaussian; but they also reveal how non-Gaussian distributions of
               breeding values will alter these dynamics. Second, an
               approximation valid for weak selection shows that even if
               genetic variance is attributable to an effectively infinite
               number of loci with only additive effects, selection will
               generally drive the distribution of breeding values away from a
               Gaussian distribution by creating multilocus linkage

               recursions, but the discrepancy may often be negligible for
               short-term selection. Third, by including mutation, we show

  abstract = "Complex traits and common diseases are extremely polygenic, their
              heritability spread across thousands of loci. One possible
              explanation is that thousands of genes and loci have similarly
              important biological effects when mutated. However, we
              hypothesize that for most complex traits, relatively few genes
              and loci are critical, and negative selection-purging
              large-effect mutations in these regions-leaves behind
              common-variant associations in thousands of less critical regions
              instead. We refer to this phenomenon as flattening. To quantify
              its effects, we introduce a mathematical definition of
              polygenicity, the effective number of independently associated
              SNPs (Me), which describes how evenly the heritability of a trait
              is spread across the genome. We developed a method, stratified LD
              fourth moments regression (S-LD4M), to estimate Me, validating
              that it produces robust estimates in simulations. Analyzing 33
              complex traits (average N = 361k), we determined that
              heritability is spread ∼4$\times$ more evenly among common SNPs

              evolutionary modeling of new mutations, suggests that complex
              traits would be orders of magnitude less polygenic if not for the
              influence of negative selection. We also determined that
              heritability is spread more evenly within functionally important
              regions in proportion to their heritability enrichment;
              functionally important regions do not harbor common SNPs with
              greatly increased causal effect sizes, due to selective
              constraint. Our results suggest that for most complex traits, the
              genes and loci with the most critical biological effects often
              differ from those with the strongest common-variant associations.",

  abstract = "Linked selection is a major driver of genetic diversity.
              Selection against deleterious mutations removes linked neutral
              diversity (background selection [BGS]) [1], creating a positive
              correlation between recombination rates and genetic diversity.
              Purifying selection against recessive variants, however, can also
              lead to associative overdominance (AOD) [2, 3], due to an
              apparent heterozygote advantage at linked neutral loci that
              opposes the loss of neutral diversity by BGS. Zhao and
              Charlesworth [3] identified the conditions under which AOD should
              dominate over BGS in a single-locus model and suggested that the
              effect of AOD could become stronger if multiple linked
              deleterious variants co-segregate. We present a model describing
              how and under which conditions multi-locus dynamics can amplify
              the effects of AOD. We derive the conditions for a transition
              from BGS to AOD due to pseudo-overdominance [4], i.e., a form of
              balancing selection that maintains complementary deleterious
              haplotypes that mask the effect of recessive deleterious
              mutations. Simulations confirm these findings and show that
              multi-locus AOD can increase diversity in low-recombination
              regions much more strongly than previously appreciated. While BGS
              is known to drive genome-wide diversity in humans [5], the
              observation of a resurgence of genetic diversity in regions of
              very low recombination is indicative of AOD. We identify 22 such
              regions in the human genome consistent with multi-locus AOD. Our
              results demonstrate that AOD may play an important role in the
              evolution of low-recombination regions of many species.",

  abstract = "The Wright-Fisher model of allele dynamics forms the basis for
              most theoretical and applied research in population genetics. Our
              understanding of genetic drift, and its role in suppressing the
              deterministic forces of Darwinian selection has relied on the
              specific form of sampling inherent to the Wright-Fisher model and
              its diffusion limit. Here we introduce and analyze a broad class
              of forward-time population models that share the same mean and
              variance as the Wright-Fisher model, but may otherwise differ.
              The proposed class unifies and further generalizes a number of
              population-genetic processes of recent interest, including the
              $\Lambda$ and Cannings processes. Even though these models all
              have the same variance effective population size, they encode a
              rich diversity of alternative forms of genetic drift, with
              significant consequences for allele dynamics. We characterize in
              detail the behavior of standard population-genetic quantities
              across this family of generalized models. Some quantities, such
              as heterozygosity, remain unchanged; but others, such as neutral
              absorption times and fixation probabilities under selection,
              deviate by orders of magnitude from the Wright-Fisher model. We
              show that generalized population models can produce startling
              phenomena that differ qualitatively from classical behavior -
              such as assured fixation of a new mutant despite the presence of
              genetic drift. We derive the forward-time continuum limits of the
              generalized processes, analogous to Kimura's diffusion limit of
              the Wright-Fisher process, and we discuss their relationships to
              the Kingman and non-Kingman coalescents. Finally, we demonstrate
              that some non-diffusive, generalized models are more likely, in
              certain respects, than the Wright-Fisher model itself, given
              empirical data from Drosophila populations.",

              strongly influenced by selection on linked regions of the genome,

              incomplete. Recent work has focused on predicting the
              distribution of fitness within an evolving population, and this
              forms the basis for several methods that leverage the fitness
              distribution to predict the patterns of genetic diversity when
              selection is strong. However, in weakly selected populations
              random fluctuations due to genetic drift are more severe, and
              neither the distribution of fitness nor the sequence diversity
              within the population are well understood. Here, we briefly

  author    = "Robertson, Alan",
  abstract  = "1. A mathematical theory of the culling process in dairy cattle
               has been developed. This was necessary to give a conceptual
               framework for the discussion of longevity in the dairy herd as a
               heritable character, of its genetic relationship with milk yield
               and of the effects of selection on the genetical analysis of
               yield itself.2. Culling is assumed to take place at the end of
               each lactation by truncation selection of a normally distributed
               variate (the culling variate) of which yield itself is a
               component.3. Expressions are then derived for the effect of the
               culling on various parameters of yield and for survival as a
               function of yield.4. The derivation of expressions relevant to
               progeny groups is dependent on the relative values of the
               genetic and phenotypic regressions of the culling variate on
               yield.5. Because little is known of the actual causes of
               culling, it is not permissible to predict the genetic gain in
               yield by multiplying the selection differential by the
               heritability. This is only justified if the genetic and
               phenotypic regressions of the culling variate on yield are
               equal.6. A direct estimate of the genetic gain by selection can,
               however, be obtained from the covariance for any character
               between the mean relative survival of progeny groups and their
               mean value for the character.7. The effect of culling on the
               genetic analysis of yield in later lactations is discussed, as
               is the effect of later culling on survival to later ages as a
               function of early yield. It is suggested that the regression
               coefficient of relative survival of progeny groups on heifer
               yield will be approximately linear with age whereas that of
               individuals will probably increase to a limiting value.8. The
               heritability of survival to different ages will probably pass
               through a maximum at the fourth lactation.9. Longevity itself,
               as a function of heifer yield, is the sum of the cumulative
               survival curves to each individual lactation. The regression of
               length of life on heifer yield, at the individual or at the
               progeny test level, can be related to the mean phenotypic and
               genetic selection applied to animals in the herd at any time.10.
               Because culling is to a large extent a voluntary action of the
               farmer, longevity in the dairy herd, though it is under
               continual selection and may have a significant heritability,

  abstract  = "When a favourable mutation sweeps to fixation, those genes
               initially linked to it increase in frequency; on average, this
               reduces diversity in the surrounding region of the genome. In
               the first analysis of this `hitch-hiking' effect, Maynard-Smith
               and Haigh (1974) followed the increase of the neutral allele
               that chanced to be associated with the new mutation in the first
               generation, and assumed that the subsequent increase was
               deterministic. Later analyses, based on either coalescence
               arguments, or on diffusion equations for the mean and variance
               of allele frequency, have also made one or both of these
               assumptions. In the early generations, stochastic fluctuations
               in the frequency of the selected allele, and coalescence of
               neutral lineages, can be accounted for correctly by following
               relationships between genes conditional on the number of copies
               of the favourable allele. This analysis shows that the
               hitch-hiking effect is increased because an allele that is
               destined to fix tends to increase more rapidly than
               exponentially. However, the identity generated by the selective
               sweep has the same form as in previous work, h[r/s] (2 Ns)−2r/s,
               where h[r/s] tends to 1 with tight linkage. This analysis is
               extended to samples of many genes; then, genes may trace back to
               several families of lineages, each related through a common
               ancestor early in the selective sweep. Simulations show that the
               number and sizes of these families can (in principle) be used to
               make separate estimates of r/s and Ns.",

  author    = "Wray, N R and Thompson, R",
  abstract  = "A method is presented for the prediction of rate of inbreeding
               for populations with discrete generations. The matrix of
               Wright's numerator relationships is partitioned into
               'contribution' matrices which describe the contribution of the
               Mendelian sampling of genes of ancestors in a given generation
               to the relationship between individuals in later generations.
               These contributions stabilize with time and the value to which
               they stabilize is shown to be related to the asymptotic rate of
               inbreeding and therefore also the effective population size, Ne
               approximately 2N/(mu 2r + sigma 2r), where N is the number of
               individuals per generation and mu r and sigma 2r are the mean
               and variance of long-term relationships or long-term
               contributions. These stabilized values are then predicted using
               a recursive equation via the concept of selective advantage for
               populations with hierarchical mating structures undergoing mass
               selection. Account is taken of the change in genetic parameters
               as a consequence of selection and also the increasing
               'competitiveness' of contemporaries as selection proceeds.
               Examples are given and predicted rates of inbreeding are
               compared to those calculated in simulations. For populations of
               20 males and 20, 40, 100 or 200 females the rate of inbreeding
               was found to increase by as much as 75\% over the rate of
               inbreeding in an unselected population depending on mating
               ratio, selection intensity and heritability of the selected
               trait. The prediction presented here estimated the rate of
               inbreeding usually within 5\% of that calculated from
               simulation.",

  abstract = "Theoretical arguments are presented which suggest that each
              advance of Muller's ratchet in a haploid asexual population
              causes the fixation of a deleterious mutation at a single locus.
              A similar process operates in a diploid, fully asexual population
              under a wide range of parameter values, with respect to fixation
              within one of the two haploid genomes. Fixations of deleterious
              mutations in asexual species can thus be greatly accelerated in
              comparison with a freely recombining genome, if the ratchet is
              operating. In a diploid with segregation of a single chromosome,
              but no crossing over within the chromosome, the advance of the
              ratchet can be decoupled from fixation if mutations are
              sufficiently close to recessivity. A new analytical approximation
              for the rate of advance of the ratchet is proposed. Simulation
              results are presented that validate the assertions about
              fixation. The simulations show that none of the analytical
              approximations for the rate of advance of the ratchet are
              satisfactory when population size is large. The relevance of
              these results for evolutionary processes such as Y chromosome

              also be important in the evolution of mate choice in animals. No
              information is available on the rate at which spontaneous
              mutations with small effects on fitness arise, although viability
              (probability of survival to adulthood) has been studied in
              Drosophila melanogaster. These experiments involved the
              accumulation of spontaneous mutations in the virtual absence of
              natural selection, in a set of independently maintained lines
              with a common origin. The rates of decline in mean and increase

  abstract = "There is increasing evidence that background selection, the
              effects of the elimination of recurring deleterious mutations by
              natural selection on variability at linked sites, may be a major
              factor shaping genome-wide patterns of genetic diversity. To
              accurately quantify the importance of background selection, it is
              vital to have computationally efficient models that include
              essential biological features. To this end, a structured
              coalescent procedure is used to construct a model of background
              selection that takes into account the effects of recombination,
              recent changes in population size and variation in selection
              coefficients against deleterious mutations across sites.
              Furthermore, this model allows a flexible organization of
              selected and neutral sites in the region concerned, and has the
              ability to generate sequence variability at both selected and
              neutral sites, allowing the correlation between these two types
              of sites to be studied. The accuracy of the model is verified by
              checking against the results of forward simulations. These
              simulations also reveal several patterns of diversity that are in
              qualitative agreement with observations reported in recent

  abstract = "In sexual populations, selection operates neither on the whole
              genome, which is repeatedly taken apart and reassembled by
              recombination, nor on individual alleles that are tightly linked
              to the chromosomal neighborhood. The resulting interference
              between linked alleles reduces the efficiency of selection and
              distorts patterns of genetic diversity. Inference of evolutionary
              history from diversity shaped by linked selection requires an
              understanding of these patterns. Here, we present a simple but
              powerful scaling analysis identifying the unit of selection as
              the genomic ``linkage block'' with a characteristic length, ,
              determined in a self-consistent manner by the condition that the
              rate of recombination within the block is comparable to the
              fitness differences between different alleles of the block. We
              find that an asexual model with the strength of selection tuned
              to that of the linkage block provides an excellent description of
              genetic diversity and the site frequency spectra compared with
              computer simulations. This linkage block approximation is
              accurate for the entire spectrum of strength of selection and is
              particularly powerful in scenarios with many weakly selected
              loci. The latter limit allows us to characterize coalescence,
              genetic diversity, and the speed of adaptation in the
              infinitesimal model of quantitative genetics.",

  abstract = "Events in primate evolution are often dated by assuming a
              constant rate of substitution per unit time, but the validity of
              this assumption remains unclear. Among mammals, it is well known
              that there exists substantial variation in yearly substitution
              rates. Such variation is to be expected from differences in life
              history traits, suggesting it should also be found among
              primates. Motivated by these considerations, we analyze whole
              genomes from 10 primate species, including Old World Monkeys
              (OWMs), New World Monkeys (NWMs), and apes, focusing on
              putatively neutral autosomal sites and controlling for possible
              effects of biased gene conversion and methylation at CpG sites.
              We find that substitution rates are up to 64\% higher in lineages
              leading from the hominoid-NWM ancestor to NWMs than to apes.
              Within apes, rates are ∼2\% higher in chimpanzees and ∼7\% higher
              in the gorilla than in humans. Substitution types subject to
              biased gene conversion show no more variation among species than
              those not subject to it. Not all mutation types behave similarly,
              however; in particular, transitions at CpG sites exhibit a more
              clocklike behavior than do other types, presumably because of
              their nonreplicative origin. Thus, not only the total rate, but
              also the mutational spectrum, varies among primates. This finding
              suggests that events in primate evolution are most reliably dated
              using CpG transitions. Taking this approach, we estimate the
              human and chimpanzee divergence time is 12.1 million years,​ and

  abstract  = "Rapid phenotypic adaptation is often observed in natural
               populations and selection experiments. However, detecting the
               genome-wide impact of this selection is difficult since
               adaptation often proceeds from standing variation and selection
               on polygenic traits, both of which may leave faint genomic
               signals indistinguishable from a noisy background of genetic
               drift. One promising signal comes from the genome-wide
               covariance between allele frequency changes observable from
               temporal genomic data (e.g., evolve-and-resequence studies).
               These temporal covariances reflect how heritable fitness
               variation in the population leads changes in allele frequencies
               at one time point to be predictive of the changes at later time
               points, as alleles are indirectly selected due to remaining
               associations with selected alleles. Since genetic drift does not
               lead to temporal covariance, we can use these covariances to
               estimate what fraction of the variation in allele frequency
               change through time is driven by linked selection. Here, we
               reanalyze three selection experiments to quantify the effects of
               linked selection over short timescales using covariance among
               time points and across replicates. We estimate that at least 17
               to 37\% of allele frequency change is driven by selection in
               these experiments. Against this background of positive
               genome-wide temporal covariances, we also identify signals of
               negative temporal covariance corresponding to reversals in the
               direction of selection for a reasonable proportion of loci over
               the time course of a selection experiment. Overall, we find that
               in the three studies we analyzed, linked selection has a large
               impact on short-term allele frequency dynamics that is readily
               distinguishable from genetic drift.",

              the genetic variance but will cause a temporary change which is
              rapidly reversed when selection ceases. This change is due
              entirely to the correlation between pairs of loci which is
              induced by selection; the correlation is negative, leading to a
              reduction in the genetic variance under stabilizing or
              directional selection, and is positive, leading to an increase in
              the variance under disruptive selection. When selection ceases,
              the correlation rapidly disappears as joint equilibrium at pairs
              of loci is reestablished, and the variance returns to its
              original value. An expression is derived for the predicted amount
              of change in the genetic variance due to disequilibrium in the
              absence of linkage. The change is likely to be small under
              selection intensities found under natural conditions, but it may
              be appreciable under intense artificial selection. This limiting
              result shows that the magnitude of any permanent change in the
              variance due to selection must decrease as the number of loci
              involved increases and that, when the number of loci is large, it

              advantage of recombination, and those whose models had infinite
              populations found none. The advantage of recombination is that it
              breaks down random linkage disequilibrium generated by genetic
              drift. Hill and Robertson found that the average effect of this
              randomly-generated linkage disequilibrium was to cause linked
              loci to interfere with each other's response to selection, even
              where there was no gene interaction between the loci. This effect

  author   = "Nicolaisen, Lauren E and Desai, Michael M",
  abstract = "Purifying selection can substantially alter patterns of molecular
              evolution. Its main effect is to reduce overall levels of genetic
              variation, leading to a reduced effective population size.
              However, it also distorts genealogies relative to neutral
              expectations. A structured coalescent method has been used to
              describe this effect, and forms the basis for numerical methods
              and simulations. In this study, we extend this approach by making
              the additional approximation that lineages may be treated
              independently, which is valid only in the strong selection
              regime. We show that in this regime, the distortions due to
              purifying selection can be described by a time-dependent
              effective population size and mutation rate, confirming earlier
              intuition. We calculate simple analytical expressions for these
              functions, N(e)(t) and U(e)(t). These results allow us to
              describe the structure of genealogies in a population under
              strong purifying selection as equivalent to a purely neutral
              population with varying population size and mutation rate,

              far to quantify the overall impact of HRi on the rate of adaptive
              evolution for any given genome. In this work, we estimate how
              much HRi impedes the rate of adaptive evolution in the coding
              genome of Drosophila melanogaster. We compiled a data set of
              6,141 autosomal protein-coding genes from Drosophila, from which
              polymorphism levels in D. melanogaster and divergence out to D.
              yakuba were estimated. The rate of adaptive evolution was
              calculated using a derivative of the McDonald-Kreitman test that
              controls for slightly deleterious mutations. We find that the
              rate of adaptive amino acid substitution at a given position of
              the genome is positively correlated to both the rate of
              recombination and the mutation rate, and negatively correlated to
              the gene density of the region. These correlations are robust to
              controlling for each other, for synonymous codon bias and for
              gene functions related to immune response and testes. We show
              that HRi diminishes the rate of adaptive evolution by
              approximately 27\%. Interestingly, genes with low mutation rates
              embedded in gene poor regions lose approximately 17\% of their
              adaptive substitutions whereas genes with high mutation rates
              embedded in gene rich regions lose approximately 60\%. We
              conclude that HRi hampers the rate of adaptive evolution in
              Drosophila and that the variation in recombination, mutation, and
              gene density along the genome affects the HRi effect.",

              the most powerful and widely used tools in this area. However,
              its foundation in the Wright-Fisher model has been found to pose
              an obstacle to implementing many types of models; it is difficult
              to adapt the Wright-Fisher model, with its many assumptions, to
              modeling ecologically realistic scenarios such as explicit space,
              overlapping generations, individual variation in reproduction,

              spatial interactions and spatial maps of environmental variables.

              studied in this article. First, is there a global molecular clock
              in mammals? Although many authors have observed unequal rates of
              nucleotide substitution among mammalian lineages, some authors
              have proposed a global clock for all eutherians, i.e., a single
              global rate of 2.2 x 10(-9) substitutions per nucleotide site per
              year. We reexamine this issue using noncoding, nonrepetitive DNA
              from Old World monkeys (OWMs), chimpanzee, and human. First,
              using the minimal date of 6 MYA for the human-chimpanzee
              divergence and more than 2.5 million base pairs of genomic
              sequences from human and chimpanzee, we estimate a maximal rate
              of 0.99 x 10(-9) for noncoding, nonrepetitive genomic regions for
              these two species. This estimate is less than half of the
              proposed global rate and much smaller than the commonly used rate
              (3.5 x 10(-9)) for eutherians. Further, using a minimal date of
              23 MYA for the human-OWM divergence, we estimate a maximal rate
              of 1.5 x 10(-9) for both introns and fourfold degenerate sites in
              humans and OWMs. In addition, with the New World monkey (NWM)
              lineage as an outgroup, we estimate that the rate of substitution
              in introns is 30\% higher in the OWM lineage than in the human
              lineage. Clearly, there is no global molecular clock in
              eutherians. Second, although many studies have indicated
              considerable variation in the mutation rate among regions of the
              mammalian genome, a recent study proposed a uniform rate. Using
              new and existing intron sequence data from higher primates, we
              find significant rate variation among genomic regions and a

              purifying selection on a genealogy is to shift the distribution
              of mutations on the tree, whereas the shape of the tree remains
              largely unchanged. This result is relevant to the large number of

              neutrality for segregating polymorphisms--applying these

  abstract = "The assumption that selection alters the genealogical tree of a
              sample of alleles from a population relative to the neutral
              expectation underlies several ``tests of neutrality.'' Two recent
              papers have studied the effect of purifying selection; their
              suggestive but incomplete results indicate that, in the single
              site case, the shape of a gene genealogy for a locus may differ
              only from the neutral expectation. We verify this finding for
              weak selection using the ``ancestral selection graph.'' We
              consider a wider range of models, including both a four-allele
              single-site model and an infinite-sites model. Our results
              confirm the previous claim for the symmetric-mutation single site
              model. We emphasize, however, that a neutral-seeming genealogy is
              consistent with detectable effects of selection on the
              distribution of allele frequences within the sample. With
              selection operating, the information about a sample cannot be
              reduced to the genealogy. As a result, a distinction needs to be
              made between the selected sites themselves, for which the
              genealogy offers insufficient information, and linked neutral
              variation. This distinction seems to have been overlooked in
              previous papers, yet it has significant implications for the
              interpretation of data on DNA sequence variation. In particular,
              it predicts that under purifying selection, the frequency

              rare polymorphisms at replacement sites even if there is no

              of weak selection on the genealogy is specific to the model; a
              (more realistic) model of multiple linked sites could lead to a
              more distorted genealogy than is observed for a single site.",

              from across the genome of Drosophila melanogaster. It has been
              suggested that this correlation results from genetic hitchhiking
              associated with the fixation of strongly selected mutants. The
              hitchhiking process can be described as a series of two-step
              events. The first step consists of a strongly selected
              substitution wiping out linked variation in a population; this is
              followed by a recovery period in which polymorphism can build up
              via neutral mutations and random genetic drift. Genetic
              hitchhiking has previously been modeled as a steady-state process
              driven by recurring selected substitutions. We show here that the
              characteristic parameter of this steady-state model is alpha v,
              the product of selection intensity (alpha = 2Ns) and the
              frequency of beneficial mutations v (where N is population size
              and s is the selective advantage of the favored allele). We also
              demonstrate that the steady-state model describes the hitchhiking
              process adequately, unless the recombination rate is very low. To
              estimate alpha v, we use the data of DNA sequence variation from
              17 D. melanogaster loci from regions of intermediate to high
              recombination rates. We find that alpha v is likely to be > 1.3 x

              more precisely. The estimation of alpha v is important, as this

               article reviews the theory of such genetic hitchhiking,
               concentrating on effects on neutral loci. Maynard Smith and
               Haigh introduced the classical case where the perturbation is
               due to a single favourable mutation. This is contrasted with the
               apparently distinct effects of inherited variation in fitness
               due to loosely linked loci. A model of fluctuating selection is
               analysed which bridges these alternative treatments. When
               alleles sweep between extreme frequencies at a rate lambda, the
               rate of drift is increased by a factor (1 +
               E[1/pq]lambda/(2(2lambda + r))), where the recombination rate r
               is much smaller than the strength of selection. In spatially
               structured populations, the effects of any one substitution are
               weaker, and only cause a local increase in the frequency of a
               neutral allele. This increase depends primarily on the rate of
               recombination relative to selection (r/s), and more weakly, on
               the neighbourhood size, Nb = 4(pi rho sigma)2. Spatial
               subdivision may allow local selective sweeps to occur more
               frequently than is indicated by the overall rate of molecular

              exact distributions of numbers of substitutions, and the genomic

              implemented in a freely available program called phyloP. Based on

              appear to be capable of fairly good sensitivity with low

              apparent differences in organismal complexity reflected in an
              objective measure of genomic complexity? Here, we address both
              questions by applying, across the mammalian phylogeny, an
              evolutionary model that estimates the amount of functional DNA
              that is shared between two species' genomes. Our main findings
              are, first, that as the divergence between mammalian species
              increases, the predicted amount of pairwise shared functional
              sequence drops off dramatically. We show by simulations that this
              is not an artifact of the method, but rather indicates that
              functional (and mostly noncoding) sequence is turning over at a
              very high rate. We estimate that between 200 and 300 Mb
              (∼6.5\%-10\%) of the human genome is under functional constraint,
              which includes five to eight times as many constrained noncoding

              advantage of a recent, whole-genome polymorphism data set from
              two closely related species of yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae
              and S. paradoxus, paying close attention to the population
              structure within these species. We found that the average
              intensity of purifying selection on amino acid sites varies
              markedly among populations and between species. As expected in
              the presence of extensive weakly deleterious mutations, the
              effect of purifying selection is substantially weaker on single
              nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) segregating within populations
              than on SNPs fixed between population samples. Also in accordance
              with a Nearly Neutral model, the variation in the intensity of
              purifying selection across populations corresponds almost
              perfectly to simple measures of their effective size. As a first
              step toward understanding the processes generating these

              systematic, genome-wide changes in the efficacy of selection,

              gene-specific changes, which may be expected after a shift in

              inferred its parameters from the genome-wide data using a

              selection. One population, the sake-derived strains of S.

              sequences conserved across multiple vertebrate species has no

              identified hundreds of candidate loci, and the genome-wide
              patterns of polymorphism show signatures consistent with frequent
              positive selection. On the other hand, recent studies have argued
              that many of the candidate loci are false positives and that most
              genome-wide signatures of adaptation are in fact due to reduction
              of neutral diversity by linked deleterious mutations, known as
              background selection. Here we analyze human polymorphism data
              from the 1000 Genomes Project and detect signatures of positive
              selection once we correct for the effects of background
              selection. We show that levels of neutral polymorphism are lower
              near amino acid substitutions, with the strongest reduction
              observed specifically near functionally consequential amino acid
              substitutions. Furthermore, amino acid substitutions are
              associated with signatures of recent adaptation that should not
              be generated by background selection, such as unusually long and
              frequent haplotypes and specific distortions in the site
              frequency spectrum. We use forward simulations to argue that the
              observed signatures require a high rate of strongly adaptive
              substitutions near amino acid changes. We further demonstrate
              that the observed signatures of positive selection correlate
              better with the presence of regulatory sequences, as predicted by
              the ENCODE Project Consortium, than with the positions of amino
              acid substitutions. Our results suggest that adaptation was
              frequent in human evolution and provide support for the
              hypothesis of King and Wilson that adaptive divergence is
              primarily driven by regulatory changes.",

              present the results of such an analysis on an alignment of
              sequences from 29 mammalian species. The alignment captures
              approximately 3.9 neutral substitutions per site and spans
              approximately 1.9 Mbp of the human genome. We identify
              constrained elements from 3 bp to over 1 kbp in length, covering
              approximately 5.5\% of the human locus. Our estimate for the
              total amount of nonexonic constraint experienced by this locus is
              roughly twice that for exonic constraint. Constrained elements
              tend to cluster, and we identify large constrained regions that
              correspond well with known functional elements. While constraint
              density inversely correlates with mobile element density, we also
              show the presence of unambiguously constrained elements
              overlapping mammalian ancestral repeats. In addition, we describe
              a number of elements in this region that have undergone intense

              that these important elements are more numerous than previously

              characterize constrained elements. We anticipate that GERP and

              individual-based population genetics simulations with arbitrary
              breeding models, population structure and demography. This
              approach dramatically reduces the computational burden of
              tracking individual genomes by allowing us to simulate only those
              loci that may affect reproduction (those having non-neutral
              variants). The genetic history of the population is recorded as a
              succinct tree sequence as introduced in the software package
              msprime, on which neutral mutations can be quickly placed
              afterwards. Recording the results of each breeding event requires
              storage that grows linearly with time, but there is a great deal
              of redundancy in this information. We solve this storage problem
              by providing an algorithm to quickly 'simplify' a tree sequence
              by removing this irrelevant history for a given set of genomes.
              By periodically simplifying the history with respect to the
              extant population, we show that the total storage space required
              is modest and overall large efficiency gains can be made over
              classical forward-time simulations. We implement a
              general-purpose framework for recording and simplifying
              genealogical data, which can be used to make simulations of any
              population model more efficient. We modify two popular

              for recording pedigrees has several advantages: (1) All marginal
              genealogies of the simulated individuals are recorded, rather
              than just genotypes. (2) A population of N individuals with M
              polymorphic sites can be stored in O(N log N + M) space, making
              it feasible to store a simulation's entire final generation as
              well as its history. (3) A simulation can easily be initialized
              with a more efficient coalescent simulation of deep history. The

              neutral substitution patterns among taxa or along genomes is a
              major issue for detecting selection within sequences. Mammalian
              genomes show large-scale regional variations of GC-content (the
              isochores), but the substitution processes at the origin of this
              structure are poorly understood. We analyzed the pattern of
              neutral substitutions in 1 Gb of primate non-coding regions. We
              show that the GC-content toward which sequences are evolving is
              strongly negatively correlated to the distance to telomeres and
              positively correlated to the rate of crossovers (R2 = 47\%). This
              demonstrates that recombination has a major impact on
              substitution patterns in human, driving the evolution of
              GC-content. The evolution of GC-content correlates much more
              strongly with male than with female crossover rate, which rules
              out selectionist models for the evolution of isochores. This
              effect of recombination is most probably a consequence of the
              neutral process of biased gene conversion (BGC) occurring within
              recombination hotspots. We show that the predictions of this
              model fit very well with the observed substitution patterns in
              the human genome. This model notably explains the positive
              correlation between substitution rate and recombination rate.
              Theoretical calculations indicate that variations in population
              size or density in recombination hotspots can have a very strong
              impact on the evolution of base composition. Furthermore,
              recombination hotspots can create strong substitution hotspots.
              This molecular drive affects both coding and non-coding regions.
              We therefore conclude that along with mutation, selection and
              drift, BGC is one of the major factors driving genome evolution.
              Our results also shed light on variations in the rate of
              crossover relative to non-crossover events, along chromosomes and
              according to sex, and also on the conservation of hotspot density

              allows us to assess the relative contribution of demographic and
              selective effects to patterning amino acid variation in the human
              genome. We find evidence of an ancient population expansion in

              variability in the selective effects of new amino acid replacing

              consistent with a leptokurtic distribution of selection
              coefficients (e.g., gamma or log-normal) peaked near neutrality.
              Specifically, we predict 27-29\% of amino acid changing

              Our results are consistent with 10-20\% of amino acid differences

              has shaped patterns of genetic variation across the human genome.
              Previous work has documented a reduction in genetic diversity in
              regions of the genome with low recombination rates. However, it
              is unclear whether other summaries of genetic variation, like
              allele frequencies, are also correlated with recombination rate
              and whether these correlations can be explained solely by
              negative selection against deleterious mutations or whether
              positive selection acting on favorable alleles is also required.
              Here we attempt to address these questions by analyzing three
              different genome-wide resequencing datasets from European
              individuals. We document several significant correlations between
              different genomic features. In particular, we find that average
              minor allele frequency and diversity are reduced in regions of
              low recombination and that human diversity, human-chimp
              divergence, and average minor allele frequency are reduced near
              genes. Population genetic simulations show that either positive
              natural selection acting on favorable mutations or negative
              natural selection acting against deleterious mutations can
              explain these correlations. However, models with strong positive
              selection on nonsynonymous mutations and little negative
              selection predict a stronger negative correlation between neutral
              diversity and nonsynonymous divergence than observed in the
              actual data, supporting the importance of negative, rather than
              positive, selection throughout the genome. Further, we show that
              the widespread presence of weakly deleterious alleles, rather
              than a small number of strongly positively selected mutations, is

              Although progress has been made in scoring the functional impact
              of individual mutations, the characteristics of the genes in
              which those mutations are found remain largely unexplored. For
              example, genes known to carry few common functional variants in
              healthy individuals may be judged more likely to cause certain
              kinds of disease than genes known to carry many such variants.
              Until now, however, it has not been possible to develop a
              quantitative assessment of how well genes tolerate functional
              genetic variation on a genome-wide scale. Here we describe an
              effort that uses sequence data from 6503 whole exome sequences
              made available by the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project (ESP).
              Specifically, we develop an intolerance scoring system that
              assesses whether genes have relatively more or less functional
              genetic variation than expected based on the apparently neutral
              variation found in the gene. To illustrate the utility of this
              intolerance score, we show that genes responsible for Mendelian
              diseases are significantly more intolerant to functional genetic
              variation than genes that do not cause any known disease, but
              with striking variation in intolerance among genes causing

               reliable inference about demography, building a null model in
               scans for targets of adaptation, and learning about the dynamics
               of natural selection. Here, we introduce the first method that
               jointly infers parameters of distinct modes of linked selection,
               notably background selection and selective sweeps, from
               genome-wide diversity data, functional annotations and genetic
               maps. The central idea is to calculate the probability that a
               neutral site is polymorphic given local annotations,
               substitution patterns, and recombination rates. Information is
               then combined across sites and samples using composite
               likelihood in order to estimate genome-wide parameters of
               distinct modes of selection. In addition to parameter
               estimation, this approach yields a map of the expected neutral
               diversity levels along the genome. To illustrate the utility of
               our approach, we apply it to genome-wide resequencing data from

               distinguish between the contribution of sweeps and other modes
               of selection around amino acid substitutions and to uncover
               evidence for pervasive sweeps in untranslated regions (UTRs).
               Our inference further suggests a substantial effect of other
               modes of linked selection and of adaptation in particular. More
               generally, we demonstrate that linked selection has had a larger

  abstract = "A major goal in evolutionary biology is to understand how natural
              selection has shaped patterns of genetic variation across
              genomes. Studies in a variety of species have shown that neutral
              genetic diversity (intra-species differences) has been reduced at
              sites linked to those under direct selection. However, the effect
              of linked selection on neutral sequence divergence (inter-species
              differences) remains ambiguous. While empirical studies have
              reported correlations between divergence and recombination, which
              is interpreted as evidence for natural selection reducing linked
              neutral divergence, theory argues otherwise, especially for
              species that have diverged long ago. Here we address these
              outstanding issues by examining whether natural selection can
              affect divergence between both closely and distantly related
              species. We show that neutral divergence between closely related
              species (e.g. human-primate) is negatively correlated with
              functional content and positively correlated with human
              recombination rate. We also find that neutral divergence between
              distantly related species (e.g. human-rodent) is negatively
              correlated with functional content and positively correlated with
              estimates of background selection from primates. These patterns
              persist after accounting for the confounding factors of
              hypermutable CpG sites, GC content, and biased gene conversion.
              Coalescent models indicate that even when the contribution of
              ancestral polymorphism to divergence is small, background
              selection in the ancestral population can still explain a large
              proportion of the variance in divergence across the genome,
              generating the observed correlations. Our findings reveal that,
              contrary to previous intuition, natural selection can indirectly
              affect linked neutral divergence between both closely and
              distantly related species. Though we cannot formally exclude the
              possibility that the direct effects of purifying selection drive
              some of these patterns, such a scenario would be possible only if
              more of the genome is under purifying selection than currently
              believed. Our work has implications for understanding the

              pattern is not easily explained by adaptive sweeps or demographic

              affect patterns of molecular variation remains incomplete.
              Genealogical approaches such as coalescent theory have proven
              difficult to generalize to situations involving selection at many
              linked sites, unless selection pressures are extremely strong.
              Here, we introduce an effective coalescent theory (a

              genealogies in the presence of purifying selection at many linked

              chimpanzees and by comparing the genome sequences of relatives.
              Direct estimates from genome sequencing of relatives suggest that
              $\mu$ is about 1.1 $\times$ 10(-8), which is about twofold lower
              than estimates based on the human-chimp divergence. This implies
              that an average of ~70 new mutations arise in the human diploid
              genome per generation. Most of these mutations are paternal in
              origin, but the male:female mutation rate ratio is currently
              uncertain and might vary even among individuals within a
              population. On the basis of a method proposed by Kondrashov and
              Crow, the genome-wide deleterious mutation rate (U) can be
              estimated from the product of the number of nucleotide sites in

              Although the presence of many weakly selected mutations in human

              are U $\approx$ 2.2 for the whole diploid genome per generation

              synergistic epistasis. I argue that in the foreseeable future, an

              lacking. The difficulty lies in the nontrivial nature of
              fluctuations in the fitness distribution, which control the rate

              using the simple but classic model of mutation selection balance

              We show analytically how fluctuations among the fittest

              dramatically amplified effects on the bulk of the population at a

              this reduction is also delayed. This delayed restoring force

              sexual and asexual species. For a population of N haploid
              individuals and a model of deleterious mutations with effect s
              appearing with rate U in a genome L Morgans long, the asymptotic
              effective population size (Ne) and the average number of
              generations (T) between consecutive fixations can be approximated
              by [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] The solution is
              applicable to Muller's ratchet, providing satisfactory
              approximations to the rate of accumulation of mutations for a
              wide range of parameters. We also obtain predictions of the

  abstract = "Purifying selection reduces genetic diversity, both at sites
              under direct selection and at linked neutral sites. This process,
              known as background selection, is thought to play an important
              role in shaping genomic diversity in natural populations. Yet
              despite its importance, the effects of background selection are
              not fully understood. Previous theoretical analyses of this
              process have taken a backward-time approach based on the
              structured coalescent. While they provide some insight, these
              methods are either limited to very small samples or are
              computationally prohibitive. Here, we present a new forward-time
              analysis of the trajectories of both neutral and deleterious
              mutations at a nonrecombining locus. We find that strong
              purifying selection leads to remarkably rich dynamics: neutral
              mutations can exhibit sweep-like behavior, and deleterious
              mutations can reach substantial frequencies even when they are
              guaranteed to eventually go extinct. Our analysis of these
              dynamics allows us to calculate analytical expressions for the
              full site frequency spectrum. We find that whenever background
              selection is strong enough to lead to a reduction in genetic
              diversity, it also results in substantial distortions to the site
              frequency spectrum, which can mimic the effects of population
              expansions or positive selection. Because these distortions are
              most pronounced in the low and high frequency ends of the
              spectrum, they become particularly important in larger samples,
              but may have small effects in smaller samples. We also apply our
              forward-time framework to calculate other quantities, such as the
              ultimate fates of polymorphisms or the fitnesses of their
              ancestral backgrounds.",

  abstract = "The majority of empirical population genetic studies have tried
              to understand the evolutionary processes that have shaped genetic
              variation in a single sample taken from a present-day population.
              However, genomic data collected over tens of generations in both
              natural and laboratory populations are increasingly used to find
              selected loci underpinning adaptation over these short
              timescales. Although these studies have been quite successful in
              detecting selection on large-effect loci, the fitness differences
              between individuals are often polygenic, such that selection
              leads to allele frequency changes that are difficult to
              distinguish from genetic drift. However, one promising signal
              comes from polygenic selection's effect on neutral sites that
              become stochastically associated with the genetic backgrounds
              that lead to fitness differences between individuals. Previous
              theoretical work has established that the random associations
              between a neutral allele and heritable fitness backgrounds act to
              reduce the effective population size experienced by this neutral
              allele. These associations perturb neutral allele frequency
              trajectories, creating autocovariance in the allele frequency
              changes across generations. Here, we show how temporal genomic
              data allow us to measure the temporal autocovariance in allele
              frequency changes and characterize the genome-wide impact of
              polygenic selection. We develop expressions for these temporal
              autocovariances, showing that their magnitude is determined by
              the level of additive genetic variation, recombination, and
              linkage disequilibria in a region. Furthermore, by using analytic
              expressions for the temporal variances and autocovariances in
              allele frequency, we demonstrate that one can estimate the
              additive genetic variation for fitness and the drift-effective
              population size from temporal genomic data. We also show how the
              proportion of total variation in allele frequency change due to
              linked selection can be estimated from temporal data. Overall, we
              demonstrate that temporal genomic data offer opportunities to
              identify the role of linked selection on genome-wide diversity
              over short timescales, and can help bridge population genetic and
              quantitative genetic studies of adaptation.",

              statistical methods for estimating their parameters from
              large-scale genomic data, a framework for an appropriate null
              model remains elusive. A model incorporating evolutionary
              processes known to be in constant operation, genetic drift (as
              modulated by the demographic history of the population) and
              purifying selection, is lacking. Without such a null model, the

              Here, we investigate how population size changes and the strength

              sizes vary over several. This unexpectedly narrow range of
              diversity is known as Lewontin's Paradox of Variation (1974).
              While some have suggested selection constrains diversity, tests
              of this hypothesis seem to fall short. Here, I revisit Lewontin's
              Paradox to assess whether current models of linked selection are
              capable of reducing diversity to this extent. To quantify the
              discrepancy between pairwise diversity and census population

              pairwise diversity from 172 metazoan taxa with newly derived
              estimates of census sizes. Using phylogenetic comparative
              methods, I show this relationship is significant accounting for
              phylogeny, but with high phylogenetic signal and evidence that
              some lineages experience shifts in the evolutionary rate of
              diversity deep in the past. Additionally, I find a negative

               sweeps driven by adaptive substitutions to the model does not

  abstract = "Selected substitutions at one locus can induce stochastic
              dynamics that resemble genetic drift at a closely linked neutral
              locus. The pseudohitchhiking model is a one-locus model that
              approximates these effects and can be used to describe the major
              consequences of linked selection. As the changes in neutral
              allele frequencies when hitchhiking are rapid, diffusion theory
              is not appropriate for studying neutral dynamics. A stationary
              distribution and some results on substitution processes are
              presented that use the theory of continuous-time Markov processes
              with discontinuous sample paths. The coalescent of the
              pseudohitchhiking model is shown to have a random number of
              branches at each node, which leads to a frequency spectrum that
              is different from that of the equilibrium neutral model. If
              genetic draft, the name given to these induced stochastic
              effects, is a more important stochastic force than genetic drift,

  author    = "Santiago, E and Caballero, A",
  abstract  = "The general theory of the effective size (Ne) for populations
               under directional selection is extended to cover linkage. Ne is
               a function of the association between neutral and selected genes
               generated by finite sampling. This association is reduced by
               three factors: the recombination rate, the reduction of genetic
               variance due to drift, and the reduction of genetic variance of
               the selected genes due to selection. If the genetic size of the
               genome (L in Morgans) is not extremely small the equation for Ne
               is [formula, see text] where N is the number of reproductive
               individuals, C 2 is the genetic variance for fitness scaled by
               the squared mean fitness, (1 - Z) = Vm/C2 is the rate of
               reduction of genetic variation per generation and Vm is the
               mutational input of genetic variation for fitness. The above
               predictive equation of Ne is valid for the infinitesimal model
               and for a model of detrimental mutations. The principles of the
               theory are also applicable to favorable mutation models if there
               is a continuous flux of advantageous mutations. The predictions
               are tested by simulation, and the connection with previous
               results is found and discussed. The reduction of effective size
               associated with a neutral mutation is progressive over
               generations until the asymptotic value (the above expression) is
               reached after a number of generations. The magnitude of the
               drift process is, therefore, smaller for recent neutral
               mutations than for old ones. This produces equilibrium values of
               average heterozygosity and proportion of segregating sites that
               cannot be formally predicted from the asymptotic Ne, but both
               parameters can still be predicted by following the drift along
               the lineage of genes. The spectrum of gene frequencies in a
               given generation can also be predicted by considering the
               overlapping of distributions corresponding to mutations that

  author   = "Comeron, Josep M and Kreitman, Martin",
  abstract = "Weakly selected mutations are most likely to be physically
              clustered across genomes and, when sufficiently linked, they
              alter each others' fixation probability, a process we call
              interference selection (IS). Here we study population genetics
              and evolutionary consequences of IS on the selected mutations
              themselves and on adjacent selectively neutral variation. We show
              that IS reduces levels of polymorphism and increases
              low-frequency variants and linkage disequilibrium, in both
              selected and adjacent neutral mutations. IS can account for
              several well-documented patterns of variation and composition in
              genomic regions with low rates of crossing over in Drosophila. IS
              cannot be described simply as a reduction in the efficacy of
              selection and effective population size in standard models of
              selection and drift. Rather, IS can be better understood with
              models that incorporate a constant ``traffic'' of competing
              alleles. Our simulations also allow us to make genome-wide
              predictions that are specific to IS. We show that IS will be more
              severe at sites in the center of a region containing weakly
              selected mutations than at sites located close to the edge of the
              region. Drosophila melanogaster genomic data strongly support
              this prediction, with genes without introns showing significantly
              reduced codon bias in the center of coding regions. As expected,
              if introns relieve IS, genes with centrally located introns do
              not show reduced codon bias in the center of the coding region.
              We also show that reasonably small differences in the length of
              intermediate ``neutral'' sequences embedded in a region under
              selection increase the effectiveness of selection on the adjacent
              selected sequences. Hence, the presence and length of sequences
              such as introns or intergenic regions can be a trait subject to
              selection in recombining genomes. In support of this prediction,
              intron presence is positively correlated with a gene's codon bias
              in D. melanogaster. Finally, the study of temporal dynamics of IS
              after a change of recombination rate shows that nonequilibrium
              codon usage may be the norm rather than the exception.",

  abstract  = "Author Summary A central goal of evolutionary genetics is to
               understand how natural selection influences DNA sequence
               variability. Yet while empirical studies have uncovered
               significant evidence for selection in many natural populations,
               a rigorous characterization of these selection pressures has so
               far been difficult to achieve. The problem is that when
               selection acts on linked loci, it introduces correlations along
               the genome that are difficult to disentangle. These
               ``interference'' effects have been extensively studied in
               simulation, but theory still struggles to account for
               interference in predicted patterns of sequence variability,
               which limits the quantitative conclusions that can be drawn from
               modern sequence data. Here, we show that in spite of this
               complexity, simple behavior emerges in the limit that
               interference is common. Patterns of molecular evolution depend
               on the variance in fitness within the population, and are only
               weakly influenced by the fitness effects of individual
               mutations. We leverage this ``emergent simplicity'' to establish
               a new framework for predicting genetic diversity in these
               populations. Our results have important practical implications
               for the interpretation of natural sequence variability,
               particularly in regions of low recombination, and suggest an
               inherent ``resolution limit'' for the quantitative inference of
               selection pressures from sequence polymorphism data.",

  abstract  = "Selection against deleterious alleles maintained by mutation may
               cause a reduction in the amount of genetic variability at linked
               neutral sites. This is because a new neutral variant can only
               remain in a large population for a long period of time if it is
               maintained in gametes that are free of deleterious alleles, and
               hence are not destined for rapid elimination from the population
               by selection. Approximate formulas are derived for the reduction
               below classical neutral values resulting from such background
               selection against deleterious mutations, for the mean times to
               fixation and loss of new mutations, nucleotide site diversity,
               and number of segregating sites. These formulas apply to
               random-mating populations with no genetic recombination, and to
               populations reproducing exclusively asexually or by
               self-fertilization. For a given selection regime and mating
               system, the reduction is an exponential function of the total
               mutation rate to deleterious mutations for the section of the
               genome involved. Simulations show that the effect decreases
               rapidly with increasing recombination frequency or rate of
               outcrossing. The mean time to loss of new neutral mutations and
               the total number of segregating neutral sites are less sensitive
               to background selection than the other statistics, unless the
               population size is of the order of a hundred thousand or more.
               The stationary distribution of allele frequencies at the neutral
               sites is correspondingly skewed in favor of rare alleles,

               mutations, directional selection on favorable alleles (causing
               hitchhiking effects on linked neutral polymorphisms) is expected
               to occur while a deleterious mutation-selection balance is
               present in a population. We analyze this interaction of
               directional selection and background selection and study their
               combined effects on neutral variation, using a three-locus model
               in which each locus is subjected to either deleterious,
               favorable, or neutral mutations. Average heterozygosity is
               measured by simulations ([1][1]) at the stationary state under
               the assumption of recurrent hitchhiking events and ([2][2]) as a
               transient level after a single hitchhiking event. The simulation
               results are compared to theoretical predictions. It is shown
               that known analytical solutions describing the hitchhiking
               effect without background selection can be modified such that
               they accurately predict the joint effects of hitchhiking and

               results to a more appropriate multilocus model (such that
               background selection can occur at multiple sites) suggests that,
               in regions of very low recombination rates, stationary levels of

              can restrict molecular adaptation and affect patterns of
              polymorphism and divergence. In particular, we focus on
              synonymous-site mutations, considering the fate of novel variants
              in a two-locus model and the equilibrium effects of interference
              with multiple loci and reversible mutation. We find that weak
              selection Hill-Robertson (wsHR) interference can considerably
              reduce adaptation, e.g., codon bias, and, to a lesser extent,
              levels of polymorphism, particularly in regions of low

              is an important force in the evolution of nonrecombining genomes
