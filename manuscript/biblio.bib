  abstract = "The evolutionary advantage of sexual reproduction has been
              considered as one of the most pressing questions in evolutionary
              biology. While a pluralistic view of the evolution of sex and
              recombination has been suggested by some, here we take a simpler
              view and try to quantify the conditions under which sex can
              evolve given a set of minimal assumptions. Since real populations
              are finite and also subject to recurrent deleterious mutations,
              this minimal model should apply generally to all populations. We
              show that the maximum advantage of recombination occurs for an
              intermediate value of the deleterious effect of mutations.
              Furthermore we show that the conditions under which the biggest
              advantage of sex is achieved are those that produce the fastest
              fitness decline in the corresponding asexual population and are
              therefore the conditions for which Muller's ratchet has the
              strongest effect. We also show that the selective advantage of a
              modifier of the recombination rate depends on its strength. The
              quantification of the range of selective effects that favors
              recombination then leads us to suggest that, if in stressful
              environments the effect of deleterious mutations is enhanced, a
              connection between sex and stress could be expected, as it is
              found in several species.",

  abstract = "Begun and Aquadro have demonstrated that levels of nucleotide
              variation correlate with recombination rate among 20 gene regions
              from across the genome of Drosophila melanogaster. It has been
              suggested that this correlation results from genetic hitchhiking
              associated with the fixation of strongly selected mutants. The
              hitchhiking process can be described as a series of two-step
              events. The first step consists of a strongly selected
              substitution wiping out linked variation in a population; this is
              followed by a recovery period in which polymorphism can build up
              via neutral mutations and random genetic drift. Genetic
              hitchhiking has previously been modeled as a steady-state process
              driven by recurring selected substitutions. We show here that the
              characteristic parameter of this steady-state model is alpha v,
              the product of selection intensity (alpha = 2Ns) and the
              frequency of beneficial mutations v (where N is population size
              and s is the selective advantage of the favored allele). We also
              demonstrate that the steady-state model describes the hitchhiking
              process adequately, unless the recombination rate is very low. To
              estimate alpha v, we use the data of DNA sequence variation from
              17 D. melanogaster loci from regions of intermediate to high
              recombination rates. We find that alpha v is likely to be > 1.3 x
              10(-8). Additional data are needed to estimate this parameter
              more precisely. The estimation of alpha v is important, as this
              parameter determines the shape of the frequency distribution of
              strongly selected substitutions.",

              induced by selection; the correlation is negative, leading to a
              reduction in the genetic variance under stabilizing or

              under direct selection and at linked neutral sites. This process,
              known as background selection, is thought to play an important
              role in shaping genomic diversity in natural populations. Yet
              despite its importance, the effects of background selection are
              not fully understood. Previous theoretical analyses of this
              process have taken a backward-time approach based on the
              structured coalescent. While they provide some insight, these
              methods are either limited to very small samples or are
              computationally prohibitive. Here, we present a new forward-time
              analysis of the trajectories of both neutral and deleterious
              mutations at a nonrecombining locus. We find that strong
              purifying selection leads to remarkably rich dynamics: neutral
              mutations can exhibit sweep-like behavior, and deleterious
              mutations can reach substantial frequencies even when they are
              guaranteed to eventually go extinct. Our analysis of these
              dynamics allows us to calculate analytical expressions for the
              full site frequency spectrum. We find that whenever background
              selection is strong enough to lead to a reduction in genetic
              diversity, it also results in substantial distortions to the site
              frequency spectrum, which can mimic the effects of population
              expansions or positive selection. Because these distortions are
              most pronounced in the low and high frequency ends of the
              spectrum, they become particularly important in larger samples,
              but may have small effects in smaller samples. We also apply our
              forward-time framework to calculate other quantities, such as the

               has been developed. This was necessary to give a conceptual
               framework for the discussion of longevity in the dairy herd as a
               heritable character, of its genetic relationship with milk yield
               and of the effects of selection on the genetical analysis of
               yield itself.2. Culling is assumed to take place at the end of
               each lactation by truncation selection of a normally distributed
               variate (the culling variate) of which yield itself is a
               component.3. Expressions are then derived for the effect of the
               culling on various parameters of yield and for survival as a
               function of yield.4. The derivation of expressions relevant to
               progeny groups is dependent on the relative values of the
               genetic and phenotypic regressions of the culling variate on
               yield.5. Because little is known of the actual causes of
               culling, it is not permissible to predict the genetic gain in
               yield by multiplying the selection differential by the
               heritability. This is only justified if the genetic and
               phenotypic regressions of the culling variate on yield are
               equal.6. A direct estimate of the genetic gain by selection can,
               however, be obtained from the covariance for any character
               between the mean relative survival of progeny groups and their
               mean value for the character.7. The effect of culling on the
               genetic analysis of yield in later lactations is discussed, as
               is the effect of later culling on survival to later ages as a
               function of early yield. It is suggested that the regression
               coefficient of relative survival of progeny groups on heifer
               yield will be approximately linear with age whereas that of
               individuals will probably increase to a limiting value.8. The
               heritability of survival to different ages will probably pass
               through a maximum at the fourth lactation.9. Longevity itself,
               as a function of heifer yield, is the sum of the cumulative
               survival curves to each individual lactation. The regression of
               length of life on heifer yield, at the individual or at the
               progeny test level, can be related to the mean phenotypic and
               genetic selection applied to animals in the herd at any time.10.
               Because culling is to a large extent a voluntary action of the
               farmer, longevity in the dairy herd, though it is under
               continual selection and may have a significant heritability,
               need not necessarily increase.",

               initially linked to it increase in frequency; on average, this
               reduces diversity in the surrounding region of the genome. In
               the first analysis of this `hitch-hiking' effect, Maynard-Smith
               and Haigh (1974) followed the increase of the neutral allele
               that chanced to be associated with the new mutation in the first
               generation, and assumed that the subsequent increase was
               deterministic. Later analyses, based on either coalescence
               arguments, or on diffusion equations for the mean and variance
               of allele frequency, have also made one or both of these
               assumptions. In the early generations, stochastic fluctuations
               in the frequency of the selected allele, and coalescence of
               neutral lineages, can be accounted for correctly by following
               relationships between genes conditional on the number of copies
               of the favourable allele. This analysis shows that the
               hitch-hiking effect is increased because an allele that is
               destined to fix tends to increase more rapidly than
               exponentially. However, the identity generated by the selective
               sweep has the same form as in previous work, h[r/s] (2 Ns)−2r/s,
               where h[r/s] tends to 1 with tight linkage. This analysis is
               extended to samples of many genes; then, genes may trace back to
               several families of lineages, each related through a common
               ancestor early in the selective sweep. Simulations show that the
               number and sizes of these families can (in principle) be used to

              purifying selection can be described by a time-dependent
              effective population size and mutation rate, confirming earlier
              intuition. We calculate simple analytical expressions for these
              functions, N(e)(t) and U(e)(t). These results allow us to
              describe the structure of genealogies in a population under
              strong purifying selection as equivalent to a purely neutral
              population with varying population size and mutation rate,
              thereby enabling the use of neutral methods of inference and

  abstract = "The majority of empirical population genetic studies have tried
              to understand the evolutionary processes that have shaped genetic
              variation in a single sample taken from a present-day population.
              However, genomic data collected over tens of generations in both
              natural and laboratory populations are increasingly used to find
              selected loci underpinning adaptation over these short
              timescales. Although these studies have been quite successful in
              detecting selection on large-effect loci, the fitness differences
              between individuals are often polygenic, such that selection
              leads to allele frequency changes that are difficult to
              distinguish from genetic drift. However, one promising signal
              comes from polygenic selection's effect on neutral sites that
              become stochastically associated with the genetic backgrounds
              that lead to fitness differences between individuals. Previous
              theoretical work has established that the random associations
              between a neutral allele and heritable fitness backgrounds act to
              reduce the effective population size experienced by this neutral
              allele. These associations perturb neutral allele frequency
              trajectories, creating autocovariance in the allele frequency
              changes across generations. Here, we show how temporal genomic
              data allow us to measure the temporal autocovariance in allele
              frequency changes and characterize the genome-wide impact of
              polygenic selection. We develop expressions for these temporal
              autocovariances, showing that their magnitude is determined by
              the level of additive genetic variation, recombination, and
              linkage disequilibria in a region. Furthermore, by using analytic
              expressions for the temporal variances and autocovariances in
              allele frequency, we demonstrate that one can estimate the
              additive genetic variation for fitness and the drift-effective
              population size from temporal genomic data. We also show how the
              proportion of total variation in allele frequency change due to
              linked selection can be estimated from temporal data. Overall, we
              demonstrate that temporal genomic data offer opportunities to
              identify the role of linked selection on genome-wide diversity
              over short timescales, and can help bridge population genetic and
              quantitative genetic studies of adaptation.",

  abstract  = "Rapid phenotypic adaptation is often observed in natural
               populations and selection experiments. However, detecting the
               genome-wide impact of this selection is difficult since
               adaptation often proceeds from standing variation and selection
               on polygenic traits, both of which may leave faint genomic
               signals indistinguishable from a noisy background of genetic
               drift. One promising signal comes from the genome-wide
               covariance between allele frequency changes observable from
               temporal genomic data (e.g., evolve-and-resequence studies).
               These temporal covariances reflect how heritable fitness
               variation in the population leads changes in allele frequencies
               at one time point to be predictive of the changes at later time
               points, as alleles are indirectly selected due to remaining
               associations with selected alleles. Since genetic drift does not
               lead to temporal covariance, we can use these covariances to
               estimate what fraction of the variation in allele frequency
               change through time is driven by linked selection. Here, we
               reanalyze three selection experiments to quantify the effects of
               linked selection over short timescales using covariance among
               time points and across replicates. We estimate that at least 17
               to 37\% of allele frequency change is driven by selection in
               these experiments. Against this background of positive
               genome-wide temporal covariances, we also identify signals of
               negative temporal covariance corresponding to reversals in the
               direction of selection for a reasonable proportion of loci over
               the time course of a selection experiment. Overall, we find that
               in the three studies we analyzed, linked selection has a large
               impact on short-term allele frequency dynamics that is readily
               distinguishable from genetic drift.",

              Hill-Robertson effect, acting between weakly selected alleles,
              can restrict molecular adaptation and affect patterns of
              polymorphism and divergence. In particular, we focus on
              synonymous-site mutations, considering the fate of novel variants
              in a two-locus model and the equilibrium effects of interference
              with multiple loci and reversible mutation. We find that weak
              selection Hill-Robertson (wsHR) interference can considerably
              reduce adaptation, e.g., codon bias, and, to a lesser extent,
              levels of polymorphism, particularly in regions of low

              are small, the fitness consequences of wsHR interference across
              the genome can be considerable. We suggest that wsHR interference
              is an important force in the evolution of nonrecombining genomes

              recombination, nor on individual alleles that are tightly linked
              to the chromosomal neighborhood. The resulting interference
              between linked alleles reduces the efficiency of selection and
              distorts patterns of genetic diversity. Inference of evolutionary
              history from diversity shaped by linked selection requires an
              understanding of these patterns. Here, we present a simple but
              powerful scaling analysis identifying the unit of selection as

              of mutations on the tree, whereas the shape of the tree remains
              largely unchanged. This result is relevant to the large number of
              coalescent estimation procedures, which generally assume
              neutrality for segregating polymorphisms--applying these
              estimators to evolutionarily constrained sequences could lead to
              a significant degree of bias. We also estimate the statistical
              power of several neutrality tests in detecting weak to moderate
              purifying selection and find that the power is quite good for
              some parameter combinations. This result contrasts with previous
              studies, which predicted low statistical power because of the
              minor effect that weak purifying selection has on the shape of a
              genealogy. Finally, we investigate the effect of Hill-Robertson
              interference among linked deleterious mutations on patterns of
              molecular variation. We find that dependence among selected loci
              can substantially reduce the efficacy of even fairly strong

              far to quantify the overall impact of HRi on the rate of adaptive

              much HRi impedes the rate of adaptive evolution in the coding
              genome of Drosophila melanogaster. We compiled a data set of
              6,141 autosomal protein-coding genes from Drosophila, from which
              polymorphism levels in D. melanogaster and divergence out to D.
              yakuba were estimated. The rate of adaptive evolution was
              calculated using a derivative of the McDonald-Kreitman test that
              controls for slightly deleterious mutations. We find that the
              rate of adaptive amino acid substitution at a given position of
              the genome is positively correlated to both the rate of
              recombination and the mutation rate, and negatively correlated to
              the gene density of the region. These correlations are robust to
              controlling for each other, for synonymous codon bias and for
              gene functions related to immune response and testes. We show
              that HRi diminishes the rate of adaptive evolution by
              approximately 27\%. Interestingly, genes with low mutation rates
              embedded in gene poor regions lose approximately 17\% of their
              adaptive substitutions whereas genes with high mutation rates
              embedded in gene rich regions lose approximately 60\%. We
              conclude that HRi hampers the rate of adaptive evolution in

              While some have suggested selection constrains diversity, tests

              Muller's ratchet is a paradigmatic process in population
              genetics, a quantitative understanding of its rate is still
              lacking. The difficulty lies in the nontrivial nature of
              fluctuations in the fitness distribution, which control the rate

              using the simple but classic model of mutation selection balance
              with deleterious mutations all having the same effect on fitness.
              We show analytically how fluctuations among the fittest

              dramatically amplified effects on the bulk of the population at a

              reduces the mean fitness only after a delay, selection opposing
              this reduction is also delayed. This delayed restoring force

              nature, our understanding of how we expect purifying selection to
              affect patterns of molecular variation remains incomplete.
              Genealogical approaches such as coalescent theory have proven
              difficult to generalize to situations involving selection at many
              linked sites, unless selection pressures are extremely strong.
              Here, we introduce an effective coalescent theory (a
              ``fitness-class coalescent'') to describe the structure of
              genealogies in the presence of purifying selection at many linked
              sites. We use this effective theory to calculate several simple
              statistics describing the expected patterns of variation in
              sequence data, both at the sites under selection and at linked
              neutral sites. Our analysis combines a description of the allele

              the structured coalescent approach of Kaplan et al. (1988), to
              trace the ancestry of individuals through the distribution of

              only from the neutral expectation. We verify this finding for
              weak selection using the ``ancestral selection graph.'' We
              consider a wider range of models, including both a four-allele
              single-site model and an infinite-sites model. Our results
              confirm the previous claim for the symmetric-mutation single site

              consistent with detectable effects of selection on the

              selection operating, the information about a sample cannot be

              genealogy offers insufficient information, and linked neutral
              variation. This distinction seems to have been overlooked in
              previous papers, yet it has significant implications for the
              interpretation of data on DNA sequence variation. In particular,
              it predicts that under purifying selection, the frequency
              spectrum of neutral mutations will not reflect the skew toward
              rare polymorphisms at replacement sites even if there is no
              recombination between them. We caution, however, that the effect
              of weak selection on the genealogy is specific to the model; a
              (more realistic) model of multiple linked sites could lead to a
              more distorted genealogy than is observed for a single site.",

              state of the latter is called the ancestral distribution, which
              turns out as a key for the study of mutation-selection balance.
              We find that the ancestral genotype frequencies determine the
              sensitivity of the equilibrium mean fitness to changes in the
              corresponding fitness values and discuss implications for the

              difference between the ancestral and the population mean fitness,
              termed mutational loss, provides a measure for the sensitivity of
              the equilibrium mean fitness to changes in the mutation rate. The
              interrelation of the loss and the mutation load is discussed. For
              a class of models in which the number of mutations in an
              individual is taken as the trait value, and fitness is a function
              of the trait, we use the ancestor formulation to derive a simple

                   deleterious mutations, a phenomenon known as Muller's
                   ratchet. We formulate discrete and continuous time versions
                   of Muller's ratchet. Inspired by Haigh's (1978) analysis of
                   a dynamical system which arises in the limit of large

                   of accumulation of deleterious mutations. Here N is
                   population size, s is the selection coefficient and lambda

              selection against large numbers of weakly deleterious mutations

              genealogies of several species of whale lice (Amphipoda: Cyamus)

              expectations, and they are also distorted in shape (branch-length
              proportions) and topology (relative sister-clade sizes). This
              pattern is not easily explained by adaptive sweeps or demographic
              history, but it can be reproduced in models of interference among
              forward and back mutations at large numbers of sites on a

              has shaped patterns of genetic variation across the human genome.
              Previous work has documented a reduction in genetic diversity in
              regions of the genome with low recombination rates. However, it
              is unclear whether other summaries of genetic variation, like
              allele frequencies, are also correlated with recombination rate
              and whether these correlations can be explained solely by
              negative selection against deleterious mutations or whether
              positive selection acting on favorable alleles is also required.
              Here we attempt to address these questions by analyzing three
              different genome-wide resequencing datasets from European
              individuals. We document several significant correlations between
              different genomic features. In particular, we find that average
              minor allele frequency and diversity are reduced in regions of
              low recombination and that human diversity, human-chimp
              divergence, and average minor allele frequency are reduced near
              genes. Population genetic simulations show that either positive
              natural selection acting on favorable mutations or negative
              natural selection acting against deleterious mutations can
              explain these correlations. However, models with strong positive
              selection on nonsynonymous mutations and little negative
              selection predict a stronger negative correlation between neutral
              diversity and nonsynonymous divergence than observed in the
              actual data, supporting the importance of negative, rather than
              positive, selection throughout the genome. Further, we show that
              the widespread presence of weakly deleterious alleles, rather
              than a small number of strongly positively selected mutations, is
              responsible for the correlation between neutral genetic diversity
              and recombination rate. This work suggests that natural selection
              has affected multiple aspects of linked neutral variation
              throughout the human genome and that positive selection is not
              required to explain these observations.",

               sweeps and background selection to autosomal polymorphism data
               from the 1000 Genomes Project. After controlling for variation

               levels at the megabase scale. Adding the effects of selective
               sweeps driven by adaptive substitutions to the model does not
               improve the fit, and when both modes of selection are considered
               jointly, selective sweeps are estimated to have had little or no

              faster or slower than expected under neutral drift are widely
              used to identify candidate functional elements in genomic

              reductions (conservation) or increases (acceleration) in rate but
              not both, or assume that selection acts uniformly across the
              branches of a phylogeny. Here we examine the more general problem
              of detecting departures from the neutral rate of substitution in
              either direction, possibly in a clade-specific manner. We
              consider four statistical, phylogenetic tests for addressing this
              problem: a likelihood ratio test, a score test, a test based on
              exact distributions of numbers of substitutions, and the genomic
              evolutionary rate profiling (GERP) test. All four tests have been
              implemented in a freely available program called phyloP. Based on
              extensive simulation experiments, these tests are remarkably
              similar in statistical power. With 36 mammalian species, they all
              appear to be capable of fairly good sensitivity with low

               remain in a large population for a long period of time if it is
               maintained in gametes that are free of deleterious alleles, and
               hence are not destined for rapid elimination from the population
               by selection. Approximate formulas are derived for the reduction
               below classical neutral values resulting from such background
               selection against deleterious mutations, for the mean times to
               fixation and loss of new mutations, nucleotide site diversity,
               and number of segregating sites. These formulas apply to
               random-mating populations with no genetic recombination, and to
               populations reproducing exclusively asexually or by
               self-fertilization. For a given selection regime and mating
               system, the reduction is an exponential function of the total
               mutation rate to deleterious mutations for the section of the
               genome involved. Simulations show that the effect decreases
               rapidly with increasing recombination frequency or rate of

  abstract  = "Author Summary A central goal of evolutionary genetics is to
               understand how natural selection influences DNA sequence
               variability. Yet while empirical studies have uncovered
               significant evidence for selection in many natural populations,
               a rigorous characterization of these selection pressures has so
               far been difficult to achieve. The problem is that when
               selection acts on linked loci, it introduces correlations along
               the genome that are difficult to disentangle. These
               ``interference'' effects have been extensively studied in
               simulation, but theory still struggles to account for
               interference in predicted patterns of sequence variability,
               which limits the quantitative conclusions that can be drawn from
               modern sequence data. Here, we show that in spite of this
               complexity, simple behavior emerges in the limit that
               interference is common. Patterns of molecular evolution depend
               on the variance in fitness within the population, and are only
               weakly influenced by the fitness effects of individual
               mutations. We leverage this ``emergent simplicity'' to establish
               a new framework for predicting genetic diversity in these
               populations. Our results have important practical implications
               for the interpretation of natural sequence variability,
               particularly in regions of low recombination, and suggest an

               variation at linked sites. Quantifying the effects of ``linked
               selection'' on levels of genetic diversity is key to making
               reliable inference about demography, building a null model in
               scans for targets of adaptation, and learning about the dynamics
               of natural selection. Here, we introduce the first method that
               jointly infers parameters of distinct modes of linked selection,
               notably background selection and selective sweeps, from
               genome-wide diversity data, functional annotations and genetic
               maps. The central idea is to calculate the probability that a
               neutral site is polymorphic given local annotations,
               substitution patterns, and recombination rates. Information is
               then combined across sites and samples using composite
               likelihood in order to estimate genome-wide parameters of
               distinct modes of selection. In addition to parameter
               estimation, this approach yields a map of the expected neutral
               diversity levels along the genome. To illustrate the utility of
               our approach, we apply it to genome-wide resequencing data from
               125 lines in Drosophila melanogaster and reliably predict
               diversity levels at the 1Mb scale. Our results corroborate
               estimates of a high fraction of beneficial substitutions in
               proteins and untranslated regions (UTR). They allow us to
               distinguish between the contribution of sweeps and other modes
               of selection around amino acid substitutions and to uncover
               evidence for pervasive sweeps in untranslated regions (UTRs).
               Our inference further suggests a substantial effect of other
               modes of linked selection and of adaptation in particular. More
               generally, we demonstrate that linked selection has had a larger

  abstract  = "The general theory of the effective size (Ne) for populations
               under directional selection is extended to cover linkage. Ne is
               a function of the association between neutral and selected genes
               generated by finite sampling. This association is reduced by
               three factors: the recombination rate, the reduction of genetic
               variance due to drift, and the reduction of genetic variance of
               the selected genes due to selection. If the genetic size of the
               genome (L in Morgans) is not extremely small the equation for Ne
               is [formula, see text] where N is the number of reproductive
               individuals, C 2 is the genetic variance for fitness scaled by
               the squared mean fitness, (1 - Z) = Vm/C2 is the rate of
               reduction of genetic variation per generation and Vm is the
               mutational input of genetic variation for fitness. The above
               predictive equation of Ne is valid for the infinitesimal model
               and for a model of detrimental mutations. The principles of the
               theory are also applicable to favorable mutation models if there
               is a continuous flux of advantageous mutations. The predictions
               are tested by simulation, and the connection with previous
               results is found and discussed. The reduction of effective size
               associated with a neutral mutation is progressive over
               generations until the asymptotic value (the above expression) is
               reached after a number of generations. The magnitude of the
               drift process is, therefore, smaller for recent neutral

               average heterozygosity and proportion of segregating sites that
               cannot be formally predicted from the asymptotic Ne, but both
               parameters can still be predicted by following the drift along
               the lineage of genes. The spectrum of gene frequencies in a

               mutations, directional selection on favorable alleles (causing
               hitchhiking effects on linked neutral polymorphisms) is expected
               to occur while a deleterious mutation-selection balance is
               present in a population. We analyze this interaction of
               directional selection and background selection and study their
               combined effects on neutral variation, using a three-locus model
               in which each locus is subjected to either deleterious,
               favorable, or neutral mutations. Average heterozygosity is
               measured by simulations ([1][1]) at the stationary state under
               the assumption of recurrent hitchhiking events and ([2][2]) as a
               transient level after a single hitchhiking event. The simulation
               results are compared to theoretical predictions. It is shown
               that known analytical solutions describing the hitchhiking
               effect without background selection can be modified such that
               they accurately predict the joint effects of hitchhiking and
               background on linked, neutral variation. Generalization of these
               results to a more appropriate multilocus model (such that

               in regions of very low recombination rates, stationary levels of

               whereas in regions of high recombination, background selection

               to the relationship between individuals in later generations.
               These contributions stabilize with time and the value to which
               they stabilize is shown to be related to the asymptotic rate of
               inbreeding and therefore also the effective population size, Ne
               approximately 2N/(mu 2r + sigma 2r), where N is the number of

               and variance of long-term relationships or long-term
               contributions. These stabilized values are then predicted using

               Examples are given and predicted rates of inbreeding are

               article reviews the theory of such genetic hitchhiking,
               concentrating on effects on neutral loci. Maynard Smith and
               Haigh introduced the classical case where the perturbation is
               due to a single favourable mutation. This is contrasted with the
               apparently distinct effects of inherited variation in fitness
               due to loosely linked loci. A model of fluctuating selection is
               analysed which bridges these alternative treatments. When
               alleles sweep between extreme frequencies at a rate lambda, the
               rate of drift is increased by a factor (1 +
               E[1/pq]lambda/(2(2lambda + r))), where the recombination rate r

               weaker, and only cause a local increase in the frequency of a
               neutral allele. This increase depends primarily on the rate of
               recombination relative to selection (r/s), and more weakly, on
               the neighbourhood size, Nb = 4(pi rho sigma)2. Spatial
               subdivision may allow local selective sweeps to occur more

               multilocus population genetics. We use a general representation
               of selection, recombination, and drift to analyze an idealized
               polygenic system in which all genetic effects are additive
               (i.e., both dominance and epistasis are absent), but no
               assumptions are made about the distribution of breeding values
               or the numbers of loci or alleles. Our analysis produces three
               results. First, our equations reproduce the standard recursions
               for the mean and additive variance if breeding values are
               Gaussian; but they also reveal how non-Gaussian distributions of
               breeding values will alter these dynamics. Second, an
               approximation valid for weak selection shows that even if
               genetic variance is attributable to an effectively infinite
               number of loci with only additive effects, selection will
               generally drive the distribution of breeding values away from a
               Gaussian distribution by creating multilocus linkage
               disequilibria. Long-term dynamics of means can depart
               substantially from the predictions of the standard selection
               recursions, but the discrepancy may often be negligible for
               short-term selection. Third, by including mutation, we show
               that, for realistic parameter values, linkage disequilibrium has
               little effect on the amount of additive variance maintained at
               an equilibrium between stabilizing selection and mutation. Each
