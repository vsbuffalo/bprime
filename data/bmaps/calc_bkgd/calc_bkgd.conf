#
# Options for the calc_bkgd program can either be read from this
# config file or from the command line. For example, if you wish to
# specify PARAM_T from the command line comment out the paramter in
# this file and call calc_bkgd like this: 
#   ./calc_bkgd conf/calc_bkgd.conf PARAM_T=0.05
#

# These options give model parameters used to calculate B-values

# This is the mean t. t is t=sh, the selection coefficient (s) times
# the dominance coefficient (h)
#PARAM_T=0.01

# distribution to use for t. Can be one of POINT, EXPONENTIAL, GAMMA
PARAM_T_DIST_TYPE=POINT
# truncate the gamma or exponential distribution at these bounds
PARAM_T_DIST_TRUNC_LOW=0.001
PARAM_T_DIST_TRUNC_HIGH=1.0

# shape  paramter for gamma distribution
# PARAM_GAMMA_SHAPE=1.0
# deleterious mutation rate (per conserved base per generation
#PARAM_U=1e-8


# this speeds up calculations by stopping the b-value summation 
# when the remaining contribution from the remainder of the chromosome
# is guaranteed to be very small
USE_SUM_APPROXIMATION=TRUE


# All of the following options specify where to read data from

# These options specify which files recombination rates are read from.
# Recombination rates for human can be downloaded from HapMap:
# http://hapmap.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/downloads/recombination/2011-01_phaseII_B37/
# 
# The files are formatted like the following and are assumed to have a single
# header line.
#  Chromosome      Position(bp)    Rate(cM/Mb)     Map(cM)
#  chr10   72765   0.124459        0.000000
#  chr10   94172   0.160359        0.002664
#  chr10   94426   0.158828        0.002705

# Recombination rates need to be scaled so that they give the number
# of expected crossovers per generation per base (Morgans/bp). For example
# if the recombination map in the above files is in units of cM/Mb then
# the scale should be 1e-8. This is because the rates need to be multiplied 
# by 1e-2 to convert from cM to M, and and by 1e-6 to convert from Mb to bp.
#
RECOMB_RATE_SCALE=1e-8

# These options point to files that contain the genomic locations of
# conserved segments under purifying selection.  The files are assumed
# to be in BED format. Conserved segments can be identified from inter-species
# divergence using a program like phastcons, or can just be a list of 
# features of interest (for example all annotateed exons).

# Output files ending in .bkgd are written to this directory.
# The output contains two columns. The first column is the 
# B value * 1000, the second column is the number of bases
# with that B-value. Here is some example output:
#  964 111631
#  963 106202
#  962 102116
#
# These lines indicate that there are 111631 bases with B-value
# 0.964, followed by 106,202 bases with B-value 0.963 and so on.
#OUTPUT_DIR=calc_bkgd

# chromosomes and their lengths are read from this file The file
# should be formatted like the chromInfo.txt files from ucsc. The
# chromosome name is in the first column and the chromosome length 
# is in the second column (additional columns are ignored). 
# The first few lines of this file for hg19 looks like:
#  chr1    249250621       /gbdb/hg19/hg19.2bit
#  chr2    243199373       /gbdb/hg19/hg19.2bit
#  chr3    198022430       /gbdb/hg19/hg19.2bit
#
# There must be a recombination rate and conserved feature file for every
# chromosome that is in this file.
